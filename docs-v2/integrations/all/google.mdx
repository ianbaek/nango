## API gotchas

-   Google has a unified OAuth system for their various APIs. This provider should work for most of them (e.g. GSheet, Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.).
-   You need to enable individual Google API on the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) before using them.
-   Under certain circumstances, Google expires a user's refresh token and the token refresh in Nango will fail. You can find a [list of reasons from Google here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration).
-   While setting up the OAuth credentials, the _Authorized JavaScript origins_ should be your site URL (`https://app.nango.dev` if you're testing from the Nango UI).
