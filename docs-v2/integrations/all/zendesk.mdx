<Note>
Zendesk has two kinds of OAuth apps:
- Helpdesk/support apps
- CRM apps

Nango currently only supports OAuth for the Helpdesk apps. If you need CRM, reach out or contribute it :)

## Connection configuration in Nango

Zendesk requires a user specific subdomain to run OAuth.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('zendesk', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<zendesk-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/api-authorization/authorize-in-your-app-default-ui#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

-   Make sure to create a Zendesk OAuth app (`https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/admin/apps-integrations/apis/zendesk-api/settings`), _not_ a Zendesk Sales CRM OAuth app. 
-   Zendesk oAuth apps [must be made "global"](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/marketplace/building-a-marketplace-app/set-up-a-global-oauth-client/) to connect to multiple `<USER-SUBDOMAIN>`s.
